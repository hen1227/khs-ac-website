        Did you know Project Graduation was born right here in Maine? In 1980, Oxford Hills High School launched the
        very first event to provide graduating seniors with a safe, organized, adult-supervised, and chemical-free
        celebration—and that same spirit continues today at Kennebunk High School.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is a night historically known for poor decisions, so as a community, we are collectively working to keep
        everyone a little safer. Each year, an amazing team of educators and parents works together to give our seniors
        a night to remember, and it’s all made possible by the generous support of our community.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container" id="faq">
      <h3>Project Graduation FAQ</h3>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>What’s the Backstory?</h4>
        <p>Project Graduation (often called “Project Grad”) began at Oxford Hills High School in Maine in 1980 following
          a tragic car accident. The program was created to provide graduating seniors with a fun, memorable, and safe
          graduation-night experience on a night that has historically been associated with poor decision-making.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>How Is It Organized?</h4>
        <p>At KHS, Project Graduation is organized by a small group of parent volunteers along with the Class
          Advisor(s). All parents are welcome to join the planning committee—we typically begin meeting in late spring.
        </p>
        <p>Together, we plan an inclusive and exciting celebration designed to appeal to the entire graduating class.
          The details of the event are kept a surprise until students board the buses after graduation, which adds to
          the excitement.</p>
        <p>Past experiences have included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Harbor cruises</li>
          <li>Cranmore Outdoor Adventure Park</li>
          <li>Go-karts and arcades</li>
          <li>Hypnotist shows and comedians</li>
          <li>Laser tag</li>
          <li>Tons of food: dinner, midnight snacks, drinks, and breakfast for over 150 teens and volunteers!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The event usually begins around 5:00 PM and concludes with our return to KHS at approximately 6:00 AM the
          following morning.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Who Can Participate?</h4>
        <p>The event is open to all KHS graduating seniors, and we truly hope every student will attend.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>What If My Child Is Unsure?</h4>
        <p>Encourage them to talk with their friends, counselor, or a teacher to get a sense of whether this is
          something they’d enjoy. While it is a long night, KHS typically sees about 90% class participation, which
          speaks to how positive and meaningful the experience is for most students.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>How Much Does It Cost?</h4>
        <p>The average cost is approximately $225 per student.</p>
        <p>This reflects the reality that not every venue can accommodate 150 students at once, and many of the places
          we use remain open after normal business hours, which increases costs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Why Do You Need Funds Now?</h4>
        <p>To secure the best venues and pricing—and avoid being shut out of desirable options—we need to book locations
          in the summer/early fall. Reserving these spaces requires large deposits for items such as buses, venues, and
          meals.</p>
        <p>It’s important to remember that nearly every high school in New England hosts a Grad Night, so we are
          competing with many other schools to lock in venues. Waiting until the spring before graduation typically
          means fewer options and potentially higher costs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Why Not Keep It Simple (e.g., a Bonfire on the Beach)?</h4>
        <p>Liability and safety considerations make this unrealistic. Even a casual event still requires transportation,
          food, insurance, supervision, and secured locations. Project Graduation’s structure ensures a controlled, safe
          environment throughout the night.</p>

      <h3>Business Sponsors</h3>
      <p>Sponsor your business with us! It starts at $250 (Tax Deductible)</p>
      <p>Our demographics represents an ideal audience for real estate agents, mortgage brokers, financial planners, and
        tax consultants, as major investment and planning decisions often align with the high school graduation years
        and frequently intersect with both aging parents and adult children.</p>
      <p>We are also a highly targeted audience for empty-nester lifestyle services, including travel, home
        re-decorating, and entertaining—making businesses such as travel agencies, designers, and even dog walkers a
        natural fit. Additionally, our demographics frequently engage with florists, event venues, and restaurants as we
        reach milestone moments like weddings, graduations, and retirement celebrations.</p>
      <p>And yes—our demographic is also right on time for oral surgeons (hello, wisdom teeth!) and joint, knee, and
        back pain specialists (hello, aging process!).</p>
