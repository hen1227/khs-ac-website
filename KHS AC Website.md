**Support KHS Appreciation Committee This School Year**  
**Why Support the KHS AC?**  
Each year the **KHSAC** raises funds to support KHS teachers and staffing community appreciation events. We also work hard to support our community by supporting parents.  

If you would like to make a donation to the KHSAC, please send it via Venmo (@KHSAppreciation), or drop a check in the KHS office made out to KHSAppreciation. 

**SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITY**  
**Go Rams Spirit Flags and Pennants\!**  
Show your KHS pride with our Go Rams Spirit Flags and Pennants\! Our 3x5 flags are a great way to celebrate your student and support the school community. They make fantastic gifts for Christmas, team events, or graduation and are perfect for decorating bedrooms, dorms, or displaying outside your home. Eighth-grade parents‚Äîthese flags are a wonderful way to mark your student‚Äôs transition to high school\! Quantities are limited, so grab yours today. All proceeds will support teacher and staff appreciation events.

**2024-2025 KHS Parents Directory**  
We‚Äôre working on creating a KHS Parents Directory, a convenient printed resource that will include parents' contact information (email and phone number) if they choose to provide it. Participation is voluntary, and entering your contact information is FREE. If you‚Äôd like a copy of the directory when printed, the cost is $10. We suggest a $20 donation to receive the directory and support teachers.

**Community Members Supporting Kennebunk High School**  
The KHS Appreciation Committee is creating a community database to enrich student learning by fostering connections with the local community. We invite parents and community members to share their profession, background, skills, and interests with our students and teachers by completing the form linked below. Staff will use this resource to enrich student learning through experiences like professional panels, skill-sharing, interviews, job shadows, and internships. Once you complete the form, your information will be saved and you will be contacted if your background aligns with a teacher or student need. 

Please feel free to share this with others in the Kennebunk region. 

Thank you for your consideration and participation\!

**Saying Thank You\!**  
One of the initiatives that came out of our first meeting at The Elective was finding a way to let teachers know how much they mean to the community. Please consider sharing a simple thank-you or a brief story through this Google Form. Once we‚Äôve gathered enough responses, we‚Äôll share them on our Facebook page and with the KHS teachers and staff.

[Thank you for your support\!](https://forms.gle/8kXD2ognSQWiai177)
